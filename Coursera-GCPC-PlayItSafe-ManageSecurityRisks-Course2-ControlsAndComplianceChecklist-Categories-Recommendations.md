<h1 style="text-align: center;">Create a cybersecurity portfolio:</h1>
Throughout this certificate program, you will have multiple opportunities to develop a professional cybersecurity portfolio to showcase your security skills and knowledge.

In this reading, you’ll learn what a portfolio is and why it’s important to develop a professional cybersecurity portfolio. You’ll also learn about options for creating an online or self-hosted portfolio that you can share with potential employers when you begin to look for cybersecurity jobs.

## What is a portfolio, and why is it necessary?

Cybersecurity professionals use portfolios to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge. Professionals typically use portfolios when they apply for jobs to show potential employers that they are passionate about their work and can do the job they are applying for. Portfolios are more in depth than a resume, which is typically a one-to-two page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments. You will have the opportunity to develop a resume, and finalize your portfolio, in the last course of this program. 

## Options for creating your portfolio:

There are many ways to present a portfolio, including self-hosted and online options such as:

- Documents folder  
    
- Google Drive or Dropbox
    
- Google Sites
    
- Git repository
    
### Option 1: Documents folder

Description: A document folder is a folder created and saved to your computer’s hard drive. You manage the folder, subfolders, documents, and images within it. 

Document folders allow you to have direct access to your documentation. Ensuring that your professional documents, images, and other information are well organized can save you a lot of time when you’re ready to apply for jobs. For example, you may want to create a main folder titled something like “Professional documents.” Then, within your main folder, you could create subfolders with titles such as:

- Resume
    
- Education
    
- Portfolio documents
    
- Cybersecurity tools
    
- Programming
    

Setup: Document folders can be created in multiple ways, depending on the type of computer you are using. If you’re unsure about how to create a folder on your device, you can search the internet for instructional videos or documents related to the type of computer you use.

### Option 2: Google Drive or Dropbox

Description: Google Drive and Dropbox offer similar features that allow you to store your professional documentation on a cloud platform. Both options also have file-sharing features, so you can easily share your portfolio documents with potential employers. Any additions or changes you make to a document within that folder will be updated automatically for anyone with access to your portfolio.

Similar to a document folder, keeping your Google Drive or Dropbox-based portfolio well organized will be helpful as you begin or progress through your career.

Setup: To learn how to upload and share files on these applications, visit the Google Drive and Dropbox websites for more information.  

### Option 3: Google Sites

Description: Google Sites and similar website hosting options have a variety of easy-to-use features to help you present your portfolio items, including customizable layouts, responsive webpages, embedded content capabilities, and web publishing.

Responsive webpages automatically adjust their content to fit a variety of devices and screen sizes. This is helpful because potential employers can review your content using any device and your media will display just as you intend. When you’re ready, you can publish your website and receive a unique URL. You can add this link to your resume so hiring managers can easily access your work.

Setup: To learn how to create a website in Google Sites, visit the Google Sites website.  

### Option 4: Git repository

Description: A Git repository is a folder within a project. In this instance, the project is your portfolio, and you can use your repository to store the documents, labs, and screenshots you complete during each course of the certificate program. There are several Git repository sites you can use, including:

- GitLab
    
- Bitbucket
    
- GitHub
    

Each Git repository allows you to showcase your skills and knowledge in a customizable space. To create an online project portfolio on any of the repositories listed, you need to use a version of Markdown.  

Setup: To learn about how to create a GitHub account and use Markdown, follow the steps outlined in the document [Get started with GitHub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nqRTU4H14NFytodh_tbafXthjNRD7aWU_4Cjq7pKG8/template/preview#heading=h.m08l38wqbrm0).

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Scenario</h1>

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

#### This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She expresses concerns about not having a solidified plan of action to ensure business continuity and compliance, as the business grows. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist. 

### Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 5 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to the completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Access supporting materials

The following supporting materials will help you complete this activity. Keep materials open as you proceed to the next steps. 

To use the supporting materials for this course item, read Botium Toys Scope, goals, and risk assessment report.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Botium Toys: Scope, goals, and risk assessment report</h1>
### Scope and goals of the audit

Scope: The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

### Current assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include:  

- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
    
- Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
    
- Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse
    
- Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
    
- Internet access
    
- Internal network
    
- Data retention and storage
    
- Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring
    

---
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Risk assessment</h1>
### Risk Description:

Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

### Control Best Practices:

The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

### Risk Score:

On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

### Additional comments

The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

- Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
    
- Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database.
    
- Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
    
- The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
    
- The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
    
- Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
    
- The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
    
- There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
    
- The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees, to properly document and maintain data.
    
- Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters).
    
- There is no centralized password management system that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
    
- While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear.
    
- The store’s physical location, which includes Botium Toys’ main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.

Define clear intervention methods and protocols for addressing issues or vulnerabilities in legacy systems to mitigate risks effectively.

### Physical Security Measures:
Review and update physical security measures, such as door locks, surveillance cameras, and fire detection systems, to maintain a secure physical environment for the company's premises and assets.

By addressing these areas of improvement, Botium Toys can enhance its security posture, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding its critical assets and business operations.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Portfolio Activity Exemplar Conduct a Security Audit</h1>

The Controls and Compliance Checklist that I have created closely resembles the exemplar without the detailed explanation list. I recognize the importance of incorporating explanation(s) into my checklist assessment, as it would greatly enhance the evaluation process.

I have developed a complementary Control Categories document. This document includes two additional columns: 'Requires Execution' and 'Urgency.' These columns allow for a more thorough evaluation of control measures by indicating whether execution is needed and the level of urgency for implementation.

In the 'Requires Execution' column, controls are marked as either 'Yes' or 'No' to denote whether action is necessary. The 'Urgency' column categorizes controls as 'Highest,' 'High,' 'Medium,' or 'Low' based on their priority for implementation.

By integrating these additional elements, I aim to provide clearer insights into the evaluation process and facilitate informed decision-making regarding control implementation. Moving forward, I am committed to refining my assessment methods to ensure a comprehensive and effective approach to cybersecurity compliance."
